# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Project Intro
- Technologies Used
- Images

**Project Intro**

Hi my name is Kevin Wessa and I am a student at Practicum. This project is called **Around the U.S.**, and it requires you to create the layouts for the webpage designed on Figma. In this project I implemented media queries to make different layouts depending on the screen size and we also utilized grids to make setting the cards in place way more dynamic than flexbox alone.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
