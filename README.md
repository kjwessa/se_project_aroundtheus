**Project Intro**

Hi my name is Kevin Wessa and I am a student at Practicum.

This project is called **Around the U.S.**, and the focus in the current sprint is:

1. Follow a design using only a Figma file instead of a detailed brief and...
2. Ensure the design remains consistent at all breakpoints utilizing media queries.
